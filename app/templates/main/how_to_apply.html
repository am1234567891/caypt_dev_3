                    The CaYPT Management System, abbreviated as CaYPTMS in the remaining sections of the document, is a web-based application to facilitate the registration, scheduling, room assignment, and score calculation of the Canadian Young Physicists Tournament. It allows the CaYPT committee to move away from the classic Google Form and spreadsheet-style of management. This shift allows the committee to adapt to the growing student participation and makes the CaYPT accessible to more students.<br><br>
                    The CaYPTMS is inspired by IYPTcc system adapted by the International Young Physicistsâ€™ Tournament since 2017. CaYPTMS and IYPTcc are similar in purpose but is independently developed by the CaYPT Information Team consisting of Andrew Mao and Frank Lai.<br><br>
                    The CaYPTMS project is developed in three phases.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Phase 1 is the registration and role approval module.</li>
                        <li>Phase 2 consists of room assignment and general planning software.</li>
                        <li>Phase 3 automates the scoring system.</li>
                    </ul>
                    If you have any suggestions on how we can improve CaYPTMS, please let us know by sending an email to caypt@stemfellowship.org<br><br>

                    Everyone that participates in the CaYPT is required to register through CaYPTMS. There are 4 roles that one could register as. They are team member(competitor), team leader(teacher or any other adult), juror and volunteer.<br><br>
                    The registration and role approval process for each of the 4 roles can be found in Section 3 and 4.<br><br>
